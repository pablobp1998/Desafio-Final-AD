    "Cabe mencionar que cuando tratamos de hacer esto por primera vez, leyendo los datos del csv como con los demás archivos, nos daba un error de \"unexpected end of data\" en la línea 599579 del archivo. Al mirar manualmente en el archivo no encontramos ningún error por lo que decidimos omitir esa única línea añadiendo el atributo \"error_bad_lines = False\" a la función de pd.read__csv.\n",

    "El segundo paso consiste en un preprocesado de los datos eliminando las columnas que creemos innecesarias en este archivo. Al ser cada línea una opinión distinta, podemos eliminar la columna \"opinion_id\". También pensamos inicialmente en eliminar las columnas de \"usuario_id\" y \"negocio_id\" pero al haber encontrado comentarios y usuarios sospechosos en el archivo de \"consejos.json\", decidimos que los usaríamos más adelante."

       "Had the worst experience with Safeway this week.  Although I used to love their delivery service, I scheduled a delivery for Thursday between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. and at 9:45 I received a call that they couldn't make it that day, but I could schedule a 2-hour window for Friday once customer service opened in the morning.  Called Friday morning and scheduled a delivery between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., then worked from home to accommodate this delivery since I need my groceries for a dinner party Saturday that I'll have to start prepping Saturday morning.  At noon I was called and told that no one would deliver my groceries today.  After speaking with a customer services manager, AK, I was told someone would call me to make their best effort to arrange the delivery today.  An hour later, I get a call assuring me my groceries would NOT be delivered today but that I'd be called by customer service about delivery first thing Saturday morning.  It's now 3:30 and I've heard nothing from anyone.  Looks like I'll be waiting for my refund and getting my groceries at Fry's Food Stores tomorrow morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\n",

       "Disgusting!!!! Found mold in my beer! And the manager Trevor Unck quickly threw it away and didn't do anything about it! I felt like puking after seeing that! Then when I asked what he could do he said customers come in asking for a free meal all the time and didn't care that there was nasty mold in the beer and ruined my parties dinner. They were all grossed out seeing that mold floating in the beer. He was the most unprofessional manager I have ever met with a don't give a crap about you attitude and cussed me out at the bar.

       "Happy to have discovered this little gem of a place.  Sometimes we have a bit of a sweet tooth and go out for some of the grocery store stuff.  It's good, but this is way better!  Home made ice cream in some pretty interesting flavors.  The young ladies working were very pleasant, an absolute joy to deal with.  Looks like they have plenty of regular customers and think we just might be some too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\n",
       "We love coming here for Brunch. They have incredible tasty gluten free bread for their bruschetta. Their toppings are delicious all of them. My husband loves their French Toast and gets it every time. Great location in Kierland. The staff is great. They mixed up my order and there was a small wait so they took off the whole order. Cannot beat that!!

       "Amazing food! Showed up this weekend without reservations and was told it'd be a 2 hour wait. Luckily we were able to find a bar side table which is full service. We had miso soup shared the Lima roll, JalapeÃ±o roll & the Ahi JalapeÃ±o Ceviche. The miso soup and rolls were great but felt the ceviche wasn't as good as we expected.  I also had a specialty drink recommended by our waiter which was very good and refreshing. Don't remember the name but it had grapefruit juice, gin and mint if I'm not mistaken. To end our meal, we shared the samba split which is a banana split that has caramelized bananas, candied popcorn, little pieces of flan, whipped cream and of course ice cream. \\n\\nHighly recommend this restaurant. The atmosphere is very upbeat and lively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3\n",

       "Update on how terrible this delivery service is:  Safeway gave me a dollar75 credit to make up for the fact that I got my last grocery delivery 42 hours late.  I used it to place another grocery delivery and, amazingly, I've been waiting an additional 45 minutes for it outside of my 2-hour delivery window and it still hasn't arrived and customer service can't find my driver.  Nice work, Safeway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3\n",

       "OK, I went in with really high expectations from everything I've heard about this place. We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious. \\nI was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.   \\n\\nBad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week. \\n\\nOverall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",
       "The food is great, however the service on Monday evenings are horrible. This is the second time with the same young lady who takes my order, and after taking my money the cooks will sit down and make you wait 30-40 min. The first time I had no idea and I asked why is my order taking so long? The ticket was never given to the cooks.!\" I waited over 30 min for her to even notice my son sad and sitting at one of the tables. I was the only one sitting with my son. I was really upset when I waited so long and I asked for a curtesy drink and she refused. \\n\\nThe second time after 2 months, the same thing happens. Now I had to take it personal. Same girl. Long hair in a pony tail early 20's. She even asked me what nationality I was? How is that relevant to me getting my food?  I pray they fire that girl and have a new person who is kind and loving to customers. There is another woman there and she is kind. Be smart and place your order over the phone. It's sad that a group of people will try to ruin a good business. I hope the owner reads this and looks at the cameras to really see how they treat people. \\n\\n\\nMoney is Green and that is the only color you should worry about. They do not like Hispanics, African Americans or Greeks here! Never again. \\n\\nPlease owners take care of a good thing and really understand who you have working directly with customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",
       "Our new favorite spot for Mexican food!!! A a refreshing change from the normal greasy and cheesy refried beans and rice entrees found most elsewhere. Chicken tacos were delicious!!!!  Salsa is served warm.  Really nice atmosphere and decor with live music some nights!! It's nice to have glass of wine! Very good prices and presentation! Somewhere I definitely recommend!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2\n",
       "Delicious!! The crispy chicken salad is super yummy and the apples with the toffee dip are the best thing I've ever tasted! It's great that everything is fresh. The chicken strips are way better than canes in my opinion because they're less greasy.

       "Terrible terrible terrible!  Made a huge mistake purchasing a reclining sectional sofa from Bad Boy.  After only 5 months the mechanical unit on one of the recliners was no longer functional ...thankfully I purchased the dollar500 insurance? WRONG!   I have been waiting over 3 months to get it fixed !!!  Getting through to the \"service department\" is nearly impossible. When someone finally answers they don't have answers except for \"its coming from China eventually\". The people in the store are no help!  dollar3000 later, I was totally ripped off. The sofa is poor quality and garbage.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!  Go to the Brick, Leon's etc!!!

       "I recently used this company. They helped  on very late notice. Front desk very nice. The head mover or Forman was rude, acted as though he didn't want to answer my questions. Didn't seem as though he cared anything about my things. They handled my things roughly, broke a couple of my things in the process, table missing pieces I still haven't found, and didn't bring a big enough truck to get all my things. I had to make 4 trips back just to get the rest of my furniture. I paid over dollar1000 dollars for a two story 3 bedroom home for this service that was worth maybe dollar400, which is what they quoted me at first. I would recommend this company if you want movers with good customer service and handle your things as if they cared. Now, the other workers with the Forman were great. \\nI have much to compare this to due to me moving from Florida to Las Vegas with REAL PROFESSIONALS. \\nJust a few pictures uploaded of my dresser drawer knobs that were broken. Called it in, they did offer to fix the knob. I don't know how....maybe they were going to use wood glue, lol. Maybe if they were careful this wouldn't have happened. Nothing was damaged when I moved from Florida, but moving across town this I get broken knobs and missing pieces SMDH \\n\\n\\n\\n8/13/18 \\nTonya gave me a call to followed up with me about my experience. I was able to explain everything that I was unhappy with. They do not tolerate the behavior or lack of professionalism that the crew working with my move showed. She offered to fix or rectify any issues I had. Her and the Owner were very concerned and willing to do what they could to make my experience better. I really don't want anything in return but just to ensure no one else has the same issues. Moving itself is stressful, really don't need more on top. Tonya was awesome in ensuring it would be addressed.\\n Thank you for the follow up. I truly appreciate that. Not all businesses will do this, but it seemed as though it is going to be squared away. Happy Moving!!!    2\n",
       "Idk if I'm just used to bad foot spa places in the valley but this place is a cut above the rest. 35 for a REAL 60 mins (maybe even more) You think it's just the foot, they have hot stones with that neck. Shoulder back. I happily gave dollar50 cos it was worth it. I'd give 5 stars but halfway through when other people were finished you can hear people talk through the walls which kinda ruins the vibe. \\nTourists, a tip for ya, add in the few extra dollars you're tipping and then calculate if it's worth it. Vegas is a tipping city, everyone here lives on it.

       "My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out last week and was not disappointed. The aroma of the mesquite hits your nostrils as soon as you enter. Meanwhile, your eyes catch the open fire grill slowly cooking the chicken and carne. Slowly and steady wins the race. \\nI ordered the quesadilla supreme and had my choice of meat(of course I got the carne) and a chicken taco. While my bf got the bean and cheese burrito and a carne taco. The portions were huge and delicious. The two things that are missing would be some pico de gallo and maybe give another option for cheese. The cheese had hard bite to it-think it was hard jack cheese, maybe something more mild?\\nThe owner was very nice and gave us two coupons for free tacos.

       "My wife and I have been there numerous times for lunch and dinner. The owner is a very nice host and have made us most welcome every time we have been there. I highly recommend the pad Thai and yellow curry as they are my wife and my favorite dishes there. LTAS is one of our favorite restaurants in the champaign Urbana area. We have been there many times over the past 2 years with our 5 year old and we have never had an issue taking her. The children's play area is really nice and she loves going as well. The food is excellent and the wait staff has always been very nice and helpful. Highly recommend you go and \"take a seat\" there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",

       "This is my new favorite at the lake. Good menu and great service. Emily is the best! The French dip is the best I have ever had!  I have been here 8 times since it opened ( less than two miles from home!). Everything I have had has been excellent.  Try the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich for dessert. You will not be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",
       "10/10, would come again. my gf loves it here and their korean fried chicken. we recommend any flavor really, depending upon your feel. our first try was the korean fried chicken wings in the flavor soy sauce and it was so good. the spicy rice cake is also worth it! everything on the menu is a must try!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",
       "We came for Lunch using our My Vegas 2 for 1. Had we not had the discount I would still say that the price is worth paying. Upon arriving we learned that they have a weekday brunch, which made me really excited since we missed breakfast. The omelet was perfect as were the country potatoes and bacon. I also got a piece of French Toast but between that and the syrup, the sweetness overwhelmed me. For my second round I tried a little of their Asian cuisine. To my surprise they had pork buns(so yummy) I enjoyed their chow menu, green bean and chicken broccoli. My only complaint was the coffee. This was our first cup of coffee for the day and it tasted just awful. They came from dispenser machine, which is probably why. Other than that, everything was delicious. I hope to come back for dinner sometime!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2\n",

       "Ahh yes, The Farm Kitchen at The Farm At South Mountain. I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.\\n\\nWhile they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of dollar22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, dollar22) for lunch and that was no tip included.\\n\\nWhy no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.\\n\\ndollar22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, dollar10 to dollar12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to dollar22.\\n\\nAnd honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",

He has a very good personality. Even the people working there are very nice. They make you feel at home. I have eaten in a lot of desi restaurants, but this one is the best.

       "Long story short, we (party of 4) flew into Vegas and picked up our rental car to drive out to Utah and Arizona for our 6 day national parks/scenic trip. We stopped in here to grab a quick bite before starting our trip and it was the best/worst idea ever. Best because the food was great but worst because throughout our entire trip we were comparing everything we ate to the food here and wishing we had taken some sandwiches to go (which we didn't ugh!). On our way home, we drove like a maniac from the Grand Canyon and made it back to Vegas in good time, just in time for some departure Pho. (They open at 10am! I've never had Pho at 10am!) We were all afraid the quality would've changed but it hasn't. The pho was still delicious and the Viet sandwich with ham and cold cuts was still delicious. If I'm ever in Vegas again, this would be my first and last stop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2\n",

I asked for them to contact by email only and of course they have to call my phone. I explained what I was looking to do and what I was interested in buying. Had some quick questions which if he had just did a little work he could have answered for me prior to going down there. He couldn't even do that.

       "I had to check it out since it was down the street from my house and I love Pho. I ordered the shrimp fresh rolls to start. The rice paper was fresh and the veggies inside were delicious with also a good amount of shrimp. The peanut sauce was the same as every other place...\\nAs for pho I got the shrimp pho. The noodles were good and there were 5 shrimp in the soup. The broth was okay, it had some flavour but I had to add more of my own. \\nThe service was friendly and the place was clean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",
       "Second time here. First time, fabulous. This time service was horrible. And this was to celebrate my husband's birthday, so I wanted to take him to a place I had been before and thought would be great.  So disappointed.  First, we received stale, hard dinner rolls. Last time they were fresh, crusty on the outside and light as air inside, but this time not so. The butter to go with the dinner rolls last time was filled to the top, you could see the honey and black salt, but this time it was half filled and hardly any salt and no visible honey. We ordered the fish fry; delicious. Next, we ordered our main dishes with a side of creamed corn. We got the main dishes, but not the side of corn. Our waitress never came over after the main dishes were served until 15-20 minutes later, our main dishes almost gone, to see if everything was ok, at which point we told her we never got the corn. Another 10 minutes later the corn arrived. I was already done with my meal when it arrived. Then we waited another 10-15 minutes after the table was cleared before our waitress came over to see if we wanted desert, and because we had a movie planned, we could not take a chance with her poor service to order dessert and get our bill, so we declined dessert, got our bill, paid, and as we were walking out a tall gentleman, who assumed was the manager or owner asked my husband how everything was, and my husband said, \"You don't want to know.\" And apparently he didn't because he let us walk right out without asking us what the issue was.  Sorry to say this experience left a bad taste in my mouth and we will probably not be returning. And a closing note--this place was empty when we arrived at 6:30 p.m.  I would overlook poor service if the place was crowded and the waitress had a lot to tend to, but tonight that was the opposite.                                                                                                                                                                                          2\n",
       "Went for the first time to evergreen nails! Great experience I have had in a long time. I absolutely love my nails I went short and natural after having long stilettos and coffin nails for a very long time I wanted a change! And I came in told him what I wanted and he did just that no less of my expectation. I usually don't pay to get a pedi because I feel I don't get what I pay for! But i had such a great job done to my toes! My nails are super cute. At other places my nails lift and it's the worst not only do the look ugly but the hurt as left bend along with my natural nail. Every female out there totally recommend this place! Place is clean, nice, neat, pleasant!

       "Love this place especially since it's right down the street from my house. My fur baby was a happy camper and always looks so cute with a bow whenever we leave. Love that they have a doggy playroom while they wait for their owners to pick them up! The groomers here are nice too and that's a definite plus :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
       "Worst Sushi ever! Please stay ways from this place. Had to put tons of wasabi and ginger to be able to finish what we ordered. Good sushi should need neither.

The inside is great too, they have a bar that is perfect for happy hour, and a market as well with coffee, pastries, other drinks, and various sorbets if you want something light or something to go.\\n\\nDon't be afraid to dive into the bread they bring at the beginning of the meal; the pesto is fabulous!

Wherever Yanira, goes I go!!\\n\\nI couldn't rave more about Yanira!!! not only is she an amazing stylist as well as a make-up artist, but an amazing person overall!! I feel like I'm getting my hair done by one of my girlfriends  yanira always takes my vision and turns it into a reality. And don't get me started on the relaxing hair wash/massage... I could seriously go on and on. \\n\\nTake my word and experience it on your own, you will not regret it :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",

       "Although my fiance and I had a good experience at the store itself (only after 1 salesman just walked away mid way through asking him a question). Their customer service and their \"5 year warranty\" protection service is crap. We spent almost dollar7,000 to furnish most of the rooms in our new home. The foot board and the dresser chipped off in chunks by simply running your nail over a tiny little bump. The kitchen table we ordered came broken and we had to wait 48 hours to hear from customer service before we could get a new one delivered. We ended up having to call them. FOUR TIMES. They can't get anyone to come out and repair the missing chunks on the bedroom set until a month later. Their furniture is cheap. Even their \"high end\" line is cheap. I will NEVER recommend Ashley Furniture to anyone.

       "This place was a disaster. We made appointments for 2 at 1 pm. My friend started her pedi at about 1:10. I sat with my feet in the cooling water (no bath salts that were included in the Mirage pedi - upgrade)for over 40 minutes. I had to ask my friends tech to heat it up twice. He was on the phone with my tech who had something better to take care of outside of the salon. She finally came rushing in - pissed off- no acknowledgement- no hand wash nothing. She just started trimming everything and then passed me off to another woman for the rest of the pedicure. The woman who rushed in began making phone calls yelling across the salon (apparently her outing away from the salon didn't go well) the only \"words \" in English were CVS and SRP. The woman who took over my pedi with her rubber gloves never touched the back side of my calf ever. Usually I love the salt scrub it is my favorite part. She washed it all off with the dirty water in the tub instead of scrubbing the leg. She left my leg flat on the pedestal while doing massage, salt scrub and callus remover. Clearly she isn't licensed. She never touched my calf and barely was able to use the callus remover. I wouldn't even call it a massage but a vinyl rub of the top of my calf with cheap ass lotion from a squeeze bottle watered down with the dirty (albeit no sea soak) water from the tub. This place is terrible. We received no apology and no they don't have water available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
       "I can't begin to say enough on how this was one of of my best experiences in buying a new car.  Mike Shiffman was nothing but professional during our entire transaction.  I honestly didn't have a full intention of getting a new car I was only looking. At no time did I feel any pressure from Mike only understanding as he listened to my needs and wants. Mike worked to not only fill those needs he went above getting me more than I thought I could get and even a better rate than I thought was possible, he definitely went above and beyond my expectations. This was truly a pleasure and I look forward to future transactions \\nA+++ \\nThanks again Mike!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
